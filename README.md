This is the repository for CP8319: Reinforcement Learning final project, Winter 2021 from the Computer Science Departmant at Ryerson University. This repository only contains the code we used for the Pong implementation of our project.

Authors of this project: Albina Cako, Reginald McLean and Bartosz Kosakawski.

In this project, an agent was trained to play Super Mario Kart using Deep Q-Learning (DQN) algorithm (code is not included).

The agent was also trained to play Pong game using Deep Q-Learning and Double Deep Q-Learning (DDQN) algorithms (code is included).
